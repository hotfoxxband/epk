It all started with a bottle of booze. Back in 2023, five rockers found themselves reaching for the same bottle of whisky at a dingy supermarket on the outskirts of Aveiro, Portugal.

Luke Föxx (vocals), Carlos Cascavel (guitar), Danny Hell (guitar), Gunshot Gonzalo (bass), and Jungle George (drums) locked eyes under the harsh fluorescent lights. But they aren’t just strangers; they are kindred spirits, rebels with their hearts still beating to the sound of the Sunset Strip.

The standoff turned into an all-night jam session in George’s basement. By sunrise, Höt Föxx was born. With screaming guitars, thunderous drums and enough swagger to make the old gods of rock proud, they set out to bring back the fire of an era when heavy metal ruled the world - one riff at the time.
